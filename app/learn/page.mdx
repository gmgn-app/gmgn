### Recommended testnet
- We recommend using the [Kaia Kairos](https://kaia.io/) testnet for learning purpose. It is a fast and free testnet that is compatible with the Ethereum network. Also, there is a faucet available to get free testnet tokens and we have deployed our testnet playground on this network.
- We actively search for new testnets to add to the recommended list. If you are a blockchain ecosystem/foundation that can sponsor a testnet faucet, please reach out to us in our Telegram group [https://t.me/gmgnhq](https://t.me/gmgnhq).
