## Create wallet 
- When you first go to the app, you will see a card with a black button that asks you to "Create a wallet with Passkey".
- Click on the black button to start the wallet creation process.
- Enter any username you want to use for your wallet. This username is stored locally on your device and is not shared with anyone.
- Follow your system prompts to create a wallet.

## Load wallet
- If you already created a wallet, you can load it by clicking on the "Load wallet from Passkey" button on the home screen.
- Follow your system prompts to load your wallet.

## Where is my wallet stored?
- A crypto wallet consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is used to receive funds, while the private key is used to sign transactions and access your funds.
- Your wallet is stored locally on your device. The private key is encrypted and stored in your device's Passkey vault. The public key and address are derived from the private key upon loading the wallet.

## What is a Passkey?
- A Passkey is a secure vault that stores your private keys. It is protected by your device's security features, such as biometrics or PIN.

## What if I lose my device?
- If you lose your device, you can recover your wallet using your Passkey cloud backup (often automatically by your Operating System). Your wallet is not tied to a specific device, but rather to your Passkey.

## What if I delete my Passkey?
- If you delete your Passkey, you will lose access to your wallet. Make sure to back up your Passkey securely.
